## Unfound Sounds description
Unfound Sounds is a site that facilitates record treasure hunts. Through a clean, responsive design, this Rails app succeeds in presenting a fairly simple backend via a thought-out and intuitive design.

## CSS & JavaScript

The bulk of this project's magic lies in client-side technologies. Using from-scratch CSS and JavaScript, the site takes the user through a smooth, AJAX-ified experience, revealing views for both unfound and found albums, and allowing visitors to navigate through past weeks without having to refresh the page.

## Planned features

Next up on the agenda is adding functionality to allow users to provide their location through their phone or desktop browser, with which the site will calculate distances to album locations.
